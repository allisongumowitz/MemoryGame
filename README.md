# Memory Game App

Allison Gumowitz

Memory Game is an app that allows users to play a traditonal memory card game that allows them to restart the game at any point, will alert the user when they win, or even allow up to 2,4,6 players!

I spent about 3 hours building this fun app

## Features

- [x] App loads to display a grid of cards initially placed face-down:
  - Upon launching the app, a grid of cards should be visible.
  - Cards are facedown to indicate the start of the game.
- [x] Users can tap cards to toggle their display between the back and the face: 
  - Tapping on a facedown card should flip it to reveal the front.
  - Tapping a second card that is not identical should flip both back down
- [x] When two matching cards are found, they both disappear from view:
  - Implement logic to check if two tapped cards match.
  - If they match, both cards should either disappear.
  - If they don't match, they should return to the facedown position.
- [x] User can reset the game and start a new game via a button:
  - Include a button that allows users to reset the game.
  - This button should shuffle the cards and reset any game-related state.
- [x] User can select number of pairs to play with (at least 2 unique values like 2 and 4).
- [x] App allows for user to scroll to see pairs out of view.
- [x] Add any flavor youâ€™d like to your UI with colored buttons or backgrounds, unique cards, etc.
